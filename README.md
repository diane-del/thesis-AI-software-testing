##  Overview

This repository hosts the open-access version of my professional thesis:

**“Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Software Testing: Benefits, Limitations, and Organisational Impacts.”**

The research analyses how AI is transforming software testing practices across industries, based on:
- Four in-depth case studies (Safran, Schneider Electric, Sparco, Opencell)
- A professional survey of 41 industry practitioners (QA, DevOps, managers, engineers)
- A literature review combining academic and technical sources
- A cross-analysis of organisational, technical, and ethical impacts

The work demonstrates how AI reshapes Quality Assurance—from test generation to predictive analysis—while highlighting adoption barriers related to skills, governance, data quality, and explainability.

##  Abstract (Short Version)

Artificial Intelligence is reshaping software testing by enabling smarter automation, predictive techniques, and self-healing mechanisms. Through four case studies (Safran, Schneider Electric, Sparco, and Opencell) and a survey of industry professionals, this thesis evaluates the concrete benefits of AI in testing—reduced time-to-market, higher coverage, improved reliability—while also addressing challenges such as data governance, model drift, lack of skills, opacity, and organisational resistance.

The findings highlight that AI does not replace human testers; instead, it augments their analytical capabilities. Successful adoption depends on three pillars: **technical mastery, strong data governance, and organisational maturity**. Recommendations include phased adoption, hybrid AI–rules approaches, investment in skills, and responsible AI governance aligned with European standards.

##  Survey Dataset (41 Respondents over 100)

The questionnaire, shared on LinkedIn, explores:
- Knowledge & usage of AI in testing  
- Perceived benefits (quality, speed, coverage)  
- Pain points (skills shortage, integration difficulty, reliability concerns)  
- Trust criteria (security, responsibility, regulation)  
- Future expectations (optimism for next 5 years)
